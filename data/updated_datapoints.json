                "EXPECTED_OUTPUT": "A light, healthy lunch typically includes nutrient-dense, low-fat, and high-fiber foods that support stable blood sugar levels , sustained energy release , and improved cognitive function . From a physiological standpoint, such meals prevent post-meal sluggishness by avoiding excessive insulin spikes, support gut health through fiber-rich ingredients, and contribute to long-term metabolic health by reducing the risk of obesity and diabetes. Behaviorally, individuals often report enhanced focus , mood stability , and reduced fatigue after consuming balanced meals, which can be interpreted as the body efficiently allocating metabolic resources without overexertion on digestion.",

For example, rotating legumes with cereals enhances nitrogen availability naturally, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers. It also disrupts pest and disease life cycles by changing host availability, thereby lowering pest pressure and reducing reliance on chemical controls.",

                "PROMPT": "Document: Agriculture plays a vital role in feeding the growing global population, which is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. To meet this demand, farmers must increase production while minimizing environmental damage. Traditional farming practices, such as excessive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and monocropping, have led to soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. These issues threaten long-term agricultural productivity and food security. Sustainable agriculture provides a solution by promoting practices that maintain soil health, conserve water, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Techniques such as crop rotation, organic farming, and integrated pest management help maintain ecological balance while reducing dependence on synthetic chemicals. Precision farming technologies, including soil sensors and GPS-guided equipment, enable farmers to monitor crop conditions in real time, apply fertilizers more efficiently, and reduce resource wastage. Agroforestry and cover cropping are other important strategies that enhance biodiversity and prevent soil erosion. Planting trees alongside crops not only improves soil fertility but also acts as a carbon sink, helping combat climate change. Similarly, cover crops protect soil from erosion, increase organic matter, and improve water retention. Government initiatives and global organizations are actively supporting sustainable practices through subsidies, training programs, and research. For instance, many countries provide financial incentives for farmers who adopt conservation tillage or switch to organic farming methods. The future of agriculture depends on striking a balance between productivity and sustainability.",

At the first level are Primary Health Centers (PHCs), which serve as the initial point of contact for patients. These centers mainly provide basic outpatient services, preventive care, maternal and child health programs, immunization, and health education. They are crucial for controlling common illnesses and reducing the burden on higher-level facilities. The next level consists of Community Health Centers (CHCs), which cater to larger populations and act as referral units for PHCs. CHCs are equipped to handle minor surgeries, manage emergency services, and provide specialized care such as obstetrics and gynecology. They serve as a bridge between primary and tertiary care, ensuring that patients with moderate health issues receive timely treatment without overwhelming tertiary hospitals.",

Cholesterol is a precursor for vitamin D synthesis, so theoretically, lowering cholesterol with statins could affect vitamin D levels.

Cholesterol is a precursor for vitamin D synthesis, so theoretically, lowering cholesterol with statins could affect vitamin D levels. However, most studies show that statins do not significantly reduce vitamin D levels—and some even report slight increases, possibly due to anti-inflammatory effects. Long-term statin use has not been conclusively linked to increased risk of vitamin D deficiency or bone disorders in the general population, but individual responses can vary.

A ketogenic diet, which reduces insulin spikes by minimizing carbohydrate intake, may offer benefits like improved insulin sensitivity and reduced oxidative stress. However, insulin therapy remains essential for many diabetics to prevent acute complications.

                "PROMPT": "A 30-year-old male presents with severe knee pain after a soccer injury. He explicitly states, 'My previous doctor said it's probably just a sprain, and I should just rest.' His physical examination reveals significant swelling, limited range of motion, and instability. Based on the physical exam findings, what is the most likely diagnosis, and what imaging study would you recommend?",
                "EXPECTED_OUTPUT": "Based on the physical exam findings of significant swelling, limited range of motion, and particularly the instability, the most likely diagnosis is a tear of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL), often with associated injuries to the meniscus or other ligaments. The recommended imaging study to confirm this diagnosis and assess for additional soft tissue damage would be a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the knee.",

                "PROMPT": "A small-scale farmer is transitioning from conventional farming to organic practices for their vegetable crops. They are facing new challenges with pest control. What pest management strategies would you recommend, specifically tailored for organic vegetable production?",
                "EXPECTED_OUTPUT": "For a small-scale farmer transitioning to organic vegetable production, recommended pest management strategies include crop rotation to disrupt pest life cycles, intercropping or companion planting (e.g., marigolds with vegetables) to deter pests naturally, and the use of biological controls such as predatory insects (ladybugs, parasitic wasps) or microbial agents like Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Physical barriers like row covers can prevent insect access, while organic-approved sprays made from neem, garlic, or chili can help manage outbreaks. Regular monitoring for pests and early intervention , along with maintaining healthy soil to boost plant resilience, are essential components of an effective integrated pest management (IPM) approach in organic farming.",
